That's is a little better, because it can survive changes to the irrelevant list. But if the document grows another irrelevant list at the top, you'll get the first <LI> tag of that list instead of the one you want. A more reliable way of referring to the ul tag you want would better reflect that tag's place in the structure of the document.

When you look at that HTML, you might think of the list you want as 'the <UL> tag beneath the <H1> tag'. The problem is that the tag isn't contained inside the <H1> tag; it just happens to comes after it. It's easy enough to get the <H1> tag, but there's no way to get from there to the <UL> tag using first and fetch, because those methods only search the contents of the <H1> tag. You need to navigate to the <UL> tag with the next or nextSibling members
